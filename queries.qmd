## Selecting columns/fields

This document contains SQL queries to explore the `pnw_counties` and `pnw_towns` tables in our SQLite database. (Maybe `fips` too?)

```{r setup}
#| include: false
library(DBI)
library(RSQLite)
con <- dbConnect(RSQLite::SQLite(), dbname = "pnw_database.sqlite")
knitr::opts_chunk$set(engine = "SQL", connection = con)
```

### Select All Town Names from `pnw_towns`:

```{sql}
SELECT town
  FROM pnw_towns;
```

### Select All County Names from `pnw_counties`:

```{sql}
SELECT county
  FROM pnw_counties;
```

### Select All Columns for Towns

```{sql}
SELECT *
  FROM pnw_towns;
```

### Select County Names and Population for 2022 

```{sql}
SELECT county, population_2022
  FROM pnw_counties;
```

## Aliasing

### Select County Names and Population for 2022, Aliased

```{sql}
SELECT county AS cty, 
       population_2022 AS pop2022,
       land_area_sq_mi AS area
  FROM pnw_counties;
```
